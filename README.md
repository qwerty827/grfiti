# Grfiti

Have you always wanted to leave your mark on somewhere you've been? Now, Grifiti gives you the ability to leave a mark, without any consequences.

## What does this do?
 With Grfiti, you can make an anonymous post, wherever you are at the moment. In your post, you can include pictures of the area and can leave a message to be seen by other travelers. 

As you change locations, your newsfeed automatically refreshes, so that you can stay up to date with the posts around you. If you see a post that you think is spam or abusive, you can report it, and it will be deleted afterwards. Grfiti also allows (insert stuff about twitter feed)

## What was this built with?

## Potential future implementations:
In the future, we were thinking of adding in a map within our UI. With the map UI, users would be able to see where exactly where they are on the app, and would have the ability to click on points on the map to see their newsfeeds. We were also thinking of adding an AR aspect to the map, with an avatar representing the user, could be seen walking in the map the map. 

Another thing that we were thinking of adding in the future is a function that would allow users to save posts, and have a place where users would view posts that they've saved, regardless of what newsfeed it came from. We were also thinking of intergrating Instagram, as well, so that users could have the ability to share Instagram posts on Grfiti as well.
